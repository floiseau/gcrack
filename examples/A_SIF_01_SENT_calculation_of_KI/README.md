# Determination of the Mode I Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) for Single Edge Notched specimen

## Physical Problem
This example solves the 2D elastic fracture mechanics problem of a rectangular domain with an edge crack , subjected to tensile loading.
The Stress Intensity Factors $K_{I}$ in mode I is determined and compared to an empric expression.
